MGBlog is a crappy blog with a terrible name. I mean, who thought that up? Weak, man. Anyway, it's really bad and you shouldn't use it.

## Official Documentation

It's largly incomplete, no timetable for when more is added.

## Contributing

If you want to make changes, follow git-flow.

I might not ever accept them, this project is very sparce and infrequently updated due to me working on more intersting things.

Best thing to do is to harass me with lots of github issues and/or twitter mentions.
