MGBlog is a crappy blog with a terrible name. I mean, who thought that shit up? Weak, man. Anyway, it's really crap and you shouldn't use it. Srsly, go away.

## Official Documentation

HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA WHAT DID YOU EXPECT HERE??????

## Contributing

If you want to make changes, follow git-flow.

I might not ever accept them.

Best thing to do is to harass me with lots of pointless github issues and/or twitter mentions.
